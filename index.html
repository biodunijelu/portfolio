        <div class="heading">
          <p >Experience as a Meticulous Front-End Developer, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Angular, and I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to dynamic team</p>
          <p>In my current role as a Robotic Pick Chief Crew at OCADO, I have been instrumental in supporting testing teams with new deployments, conducting User Acceptance Tests, and ensuring the smooth operation of robotic arms. My proficiency in project management and customer relations has allowed me to map out existing sales processes, gather requirements, and translate business needs into technical requirements effectively.</p>
          <p >During my tenure at VATEBRA LIMITED, I led the implementation of best practices in front-end development, resulting in a significant decrease in rework and a substantial boost in user experience scores. I successfully led a team in improving front-end deployments, designed and developed user-friendly product websites, and revamped legacy applications, leading to increased customer satisfaction and conversion rates.</p>
        <p >As a Web and Application Developer at Fleet Technologies, I prototyped and designed new product features, developed a state-of-the-art Content Management System, and designed and implemented mobile applications and fully responsive websites</p>
        <p >My educational background in Management Information System from Oxford College UK, coupled with a B.Tech in Mathematics and Computer Science from the Federal University of Technology, Minna, provides a solid foundation for my technical skills.</p>
